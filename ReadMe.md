SmallAndFast
============

A small and fast program for testing CMake, CTest and CDash.

Initially copied from CMake/Tests/CTestTest/SmallAndFast at v2.8.4

Mods added to submit (by default) to a my.cdash.org dashboard. Options added to
CMakeLists.txt to allow switching to a different dashboard URL simply by
defining some CMake variables.

THE END
